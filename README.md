Data structure

	Shipper has many job
	Job has many Bid
	Transporter has many Bid
	Transporter has many Truck

Pseudo Code

	Class Shipper
		getAttribute()
		createJob()

	Class Job
		getAttribute()
		SortBid(sort_type)

	Class Transporter
		getAttribute()
		SortJob(sort_type)
		CreateBid(job)

	Class Bid
		getAttribute()

Planning

	1. Sort Bids functionality
		Transporter
			- create bid
		Job
			- add bid
			- sort bid
		Bid
			- getter for some attribute

	2. Sort Jobs functionality
		Shipper
			- Create Job
		Transporter
			- Sort Bid

	Buat test for every functionality?

	3. Other functionality
		Assure the uniqueness of Transporter and Shipper
